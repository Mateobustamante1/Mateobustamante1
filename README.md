About Me
I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a primary focus on Front-End, although I also possess strong skills in Node, Python, and SQL. My experience has been centered around development with React, using methodologies like Redux to create dynamic and appealing user interfaces. While my primary focus is on the Front-End, I have substantial knowledge of Node for more complex development tasks, as well as Python and SQL for specific database operations and data analysis.

My Journey
Initially unsure about pursuing programming professionally, I eventually realized it was the perfect fit for my skills and analytical approach. Starting with Python, I delved into fundamental concepts through pseudocode, and later expanded my knowledge in Node and the React ecosystem. With a strong foundation in Back-End architecture and database management, I constantly seek new opportunities to learn and grow in the field of technology.
