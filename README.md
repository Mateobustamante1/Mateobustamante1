## About Me

I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a primary focus on Front-End, although I also possess strong skills in Node, Python, and SQL. My experience has been centered around development with React, using methodologies like Redux to create dynamic and appealing user interfaces. While my primary focus is on the Front-End, I have substantial knowledge of Node for more complex development tasks, as well as Python and SQL for specific database operations and data analysis.

## My Journey

I have always had a natural affinity for programming, but initially, I hesitated to pursue this passion professionally. However, over time I discovered that web development and solving technological problems were the perfect combination for my skills and analytical focus. I began my journey with Python, exploring core concepts through pseudocode and subsequently expanded my knowledge in Node and the React ecosystem.

Through my experience with tools like Node, I have broadened my understanding of Back-End architecture, allowing me to make significant contributions to more complex projects. Additionally, my knowledge in Python and SQL has provided me with a solid foundation for addressing data analysis and database management-related issues.

My goal is to apply my creativity in developing attractive and functional user interfaces, ensuring that the code is clean, efficient, and easy to maintain. I believe in the importance of honesty, dedication, and willingness to help, qualities that have driven me to constantly seek new opportunities to learn and grow in this exciting field of technology.
